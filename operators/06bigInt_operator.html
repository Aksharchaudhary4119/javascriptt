          <a target="_blank" href="#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bigint_operators  "></a>6  .  Bigint operators</h2>
        
        <h4>Most operators that can be used between numbers can be used between BigInt values as well.</h4>
        
        <pre>
          
          // BigInt addition
          const a = 1n + 2n; // 3n
          // Division with BigInts round towards zero
          const b = 1n / 2n; // 0n
          // Bitwise operations with BigInts do not truncate either side
          const c = 40000000000000000n >> 2n; // 10000000000000000n
          
        </pre>
    
        <h4>One exception is unsigned right shift (>>>), which is not defined for BigInt values. This is because a BigInt does not have a fixed width, so technically it does not have a "highest bit"</h4>
        
        <pre>
          const d = 8n >>> 2n; // TypeError: BigInts have no unsigned right shift, use >> instead
      </pre>
      
      <h4>BigInts and numbers are not mutually replaceable â€” you cannot mix them in calculations.</h4>
      
      <pre>
        const a = 1n + 2; // TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types
      </pre>
    
      <pre>
        <h3>
          This is because BigInt is neither a subset nor a superset of numbers. BigInts have higher precision than 
          numbers when representing large integers, but cannot represent decimals, so implicit conversion on either 
          side might lose precision. Use explicit conversion to signal whether you wish the operation to be a number 
          operation or a BigInt one.</h3>
    
          const a = Number(1n) + 2; // 3
          const b = 1n + BigInt(2); // 3n
      </pre>
      
      <h4>You can compare BigInts with numbers.</h4>
      
      
      <pre>
        const a = 1n > 2; // false
        const b = 3 > 2n; // true
