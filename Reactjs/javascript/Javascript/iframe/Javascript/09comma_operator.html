        9  .  Comma operators

        <h3>
          The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the 
          value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used inside a for 
          loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the 
          loop. It is regarded bad style to use it elsewhere, when it is not necessary.
          Often two separate statements can and should be used instead.
        </h3>
      
      <h3>   For example, if a is a 2-dimensional array with 10 elements on a side, the
         following code uses the comma operator to update two variables at once. The 
         code prints the values of the diagonal elements in the array</h3>
