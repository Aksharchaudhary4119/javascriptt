        All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".

        You will learn more about how to use strict mode in a later chapter of this tutorial.

        In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.

        Global Variables in HTML
        With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment.

        In HTML, the global scope is the window object.

        Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object:

        Example
        var carName = "Volvo";
        // code here can use window.carName
        Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object:

        Example
        let carName = "Volvo";
        // code here can not use window.carName
    </pre>
</body>
