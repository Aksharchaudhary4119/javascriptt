    <h1>1.what is javascript</h1>
    <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.)</p>
    <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.)</p>
    <p>Ans = Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.
        
        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
        
        JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser</p>
        <p>Ans = JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language. It is widely used in the field of web development. it can be used in the front end and backend. Also, JavaScript is not a compiled language, it gets interpreted through a web browser   </p>
        <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It was first introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is a lightweight language that can be embedded in HTML and is compatible with all major web browsers.
            
            JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and has a vast community of developers who share resources, tutorials, and libraries to help beginners. It is dynamically typed, meaning that variables can change their data type at runtime, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code.
            
            In short words, JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.)</p>
            <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for web development. Learning the basics of JavaScript is fairly simple. However, this language is highly interactive and has many complex features and nuances when used at an advanced level. As projects become more reliant on JavaScript, employers increasingly seek out candidates with strong JavaScript skills. In this article, we explain what JavaScript is, its uses and advantages and how to begin developing JavaScript skills to advance in your career.)</p>

                        Web browsers execute client-side scripting. It is used when browsers have all code. Source code is used to transfer from webserver to user’s computer over the internet and run directly on browsers. It is also used for validations and functionality for user events. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It allows for more interactivity. It usually performs several actions without going to the user. It cannot be basically used to connect to databases on a web server. These scripts cannot access the file system that resides in the web browser. Pages are altered on basis of the user’s choice. It can also be used to create “cookies” that store data on the user’s computer.

                    <p>Web servers are used to execute server-side scripting. They are basically used to create dynamic pages. It can also access the file system residing at the webserver. A server-side environment that runs on a scripting language is a web server. </p>
                    
                    <p>Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages available. It is used to retrieve and generate content for dynamic pages. It is used to require to download plugins. In this load times are generally faster than client-side scripting. When you need to store and retrieve information a database will be used to contain data. It can use huge resources of the server. It reduces client-side computation overhead. The server sends pages to the request of the user/client. </p>
