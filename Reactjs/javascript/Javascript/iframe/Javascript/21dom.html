    <h2>What is DOM</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>

    <p>A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
    

    <ul>
        <li>For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document:</li>
    </ul>

    <pre>
        <!-- <script> -->
            const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
           // paragraphs[0] is the first <p>            element
           // paragraphs[1] is the second <p>           element, etc.
           alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);

        <!-- </script> -->
        
            All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects. For example,
            the document object that represents the document itself, any table objects that implement the HTMLTableElement DOM interface for 
            accessing HTML tables, and so forth, are all objects.
    


            The DOM is built using multiple APIs that work together. The core DOM defines the entities describing any document and the objects 
            within it. This is expanded upon as needed by other APIs that add new features and capabilities to the DOM. For example, the HTML 
            DOM API adds support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM, and the SVG API adds support for representing SVG documents.

But there are a number of different data types being passed around the API that you should be aware of.</p>
        <div class="notecard note" id="sect1">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because the vast majority of code that uses the DOM revolves around manipulating HTML documents, it's common to refer to the nodes in the DOM as <strong>elements</strong>, although strictly speaking not every node is an element.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The following table briefly describes these data types.</p>
        <figure class="table-container"><table class="standard-table">

              <td>
                When a member returns an object of type <code>document</code> (e.g., the
                <code>ownerDocument</code> property of an element returns the
                <code>document</code> to which it belongs), this object is the root
                <code>document</code> object itself. The
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document">DOM <code>document</code> Reference</a>
                chapter describes the <code>document</code> object.

            <tr>
              <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node"><code>Node</code></a></td>
              <td>
                Every object located within a document is a node of some kind. In an
                HTML document, an object can be an element node but also a text node or
                attribute node.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element"><code>Element</code></a></td>
              <td>
                The <code>element</code> type is based on <code>node</code>. It refers
                to an element or a node of type <code>element</code> returned by a
                member of the DOM API. Rather than saying, for example, that the
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement"><code>document.createElement()</code></a> method returns an
                object reference to a <code>node</code>, we just say that this method
                returns the <code>element</code> that has just been created in the DOM.
                <code>element</code> objects implement the DOM
                <code>Element</code> interface and also the more basic
                <code>Node</code> interface, both of which are included together in this
                reference. In an HTML document, elements are further enhanced by the
                HTML DOM API's <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement"><code>HTMLElement</code></a> interface as well as
                other interfaces describing capabilities of specific kinds of elements
                (for instance, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableElement"><code>HTMLTableElement</code></a> for
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table"><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></a> elements).
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList"><code>NodeList</code></a></td>
              <td>
                A <code>nodeList</code> is an array of elements, like the kind that is
                returned by the method
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"><code>document.querySelectorAll()</code></a>. Items in a
                <code>nodeList</code> are accessed by index in either of two ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>list.item(1)</li>
                  <li>list[1]</li>
                </ul>These two are equivalent. In the first, <code>item()</code> is the
                single method on the <code>nodeList</code> object. The latter uses the
                typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attr"><code>Attr</code></a></td>
              <td>
                When an <code>attribute</code> is returned by a member (e.g., by the
                <code>createAttribute()</code> method), it is an object reference that
                exposes a special (albeit small) interface for attributes. Attributes
                are nodes in the DOM just like elements are, though you may rarely use
                them as such.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/NamedNodeMap"><code>NamedNodeMap</code></a></td>
              <td>
                A <code>namedNodeMap</code> is like an array, but the items are accessed
                by name or index, though this latter case is merely a convenience for
                enumeration, as they are in no particular order in the list. A
                <code>namedNodeMap</code> has an <code>item()</code> method for this
                purpose, and you can also add and remove items from a
                <code>namedNodeMap</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table></figure>
        <p>There are also some common terminology considerations to keep in mind. It's common to refer to any <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attr"><code>Attr</code></a> node as an <code>attribute</code>, for example, and to refer to an array of DOM nodes as a <code>nodeList</code>. You'll find these terms and others to be introduced and used throughout the documentation.</p></div>

    <h2>What is the DOM</h2>
    <p>The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.</p>
    <p>The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:</p>
    <p><i>"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."</i></p>
    <p>The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Core DOM - standard model for all document types</li>
        <li>XML DOM - standard model for XML documents</li>
        <li>HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the HTML DOM</h2>
    <p>The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The HTML elements as <b>objects</b>
        </li>
        <li>The <b>properties</b> of all HTML elements
        </li>
        <li>The <b>methods</b> to access all HTML elements</li>
        <li>The <strong>events</strong> for all HTML elements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words:<b> The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.</b></p>  


    <h2>Interview Qustions And Answers</h2>

    <h3>
        1. Can you explain what the Document Object Model (DOM) is and its core functions?
    </h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like model, allowing developers to manipulate its content and visual presentation. The DOM’s core functions include creating, reading, updating, and deleting nodes. Nodes represent elements, attributes, and text within the document. By manipulating these nodes, developers can dynamically change content and styles. For instance, JavaScript often uses the DOM API to interact with HTML elements in web development.    </p>

    <h3>2   . Can you differentiate between innerHTML and outerHTML in DOM manipulation?</h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like object, allowing developers to manipulate its content and visual presentation.</p>
    <p>In HTML, DOM treats an HTML document as a tree-structure where each node is an object representing part of the document. The nodes can be manipulated by JavaScript, enabling dynamic content updates.</p>
    <p> XML’s use of DOM is similar but more flexible. While HTML strictly defines what objects can appear in a document and their relationships, XML does not have these restrictions. Any tag can be used, and any structure is valid if it complies with XML syntax rules. This flexibility allows XML to represent complex data structures beyond web pages, such as configuration files or structured data records.</p>
