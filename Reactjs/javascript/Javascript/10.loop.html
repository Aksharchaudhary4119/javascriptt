    <h2>What is Loops</h2>
    <p><b>ANS:-  </b>A loop is a program or script that repeats the same instructions or processes the same information over and over until receiving the order to stop. If not handled properly, a loop can cause the computer to become slower as it becomes overwhelmed with repeating the same steps in an endless loop.</p>

    <h2>Making decisions in your code — conditionals</h2>

    <pre>
        In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out
        actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if
        the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if 
        it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and 
        a moon if it is nighttime. In this article, we'll explore how so-called conditional
        statements work in JavaScript
    </pre>

    <h3>if...else statements</h3>

    <p>Let's look at by far the most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript — the humble if...else statement.</p>    

    <pre>
        if (condition) {
            /* code to run if condition is true */
          } else {
            /* run some other code instead */
          }


        let MathsMarks = 50;
        let EngMarks = 60;
        let AcoMarks = 80;
        let StateMarks = 95;
        
        let TotalMarks = MathsMarks + EngMarks + AcoMarks + StateMarks;
        console.log(TotalMarks);

        let AverageMarks = TotalMarks/4 
        console.log(AverageMarks);

          if (AverageMarks < 50) {
              console.log("try it");
          }
            else {
                console.log("Nice");
            }
    </pre>

<h2>else if</h2>

<p>The last example provided us with two choices, or outcomes — but what if we want more than two?</p>

<p>There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your if...else — using else if. Each extra choice requires an additional block to put in between if () { } and else { } — check out the following more involved example, which could be part of a simple weather forecast application:</p>

<pre>
  const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  if (choice === "sunny") {
    para.textContent =
      "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
  } else if (choice === "rainy") {
    para.textContent =
      "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
  } else if (choice === "snowing") {
    para.textContent =
      "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
  } else if (choice === "overcast") {
    para.textContent =
      "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
  } else {
    para.textContent = "";
  }
}
</pre>
