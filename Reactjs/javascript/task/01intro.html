It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.)</p>
       <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.)</p>

       <p>Ans = JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language. It is widely used in the field of web development. it can be used in the front end and backend. Also, JavaScript is not a compiled language, it gets interpreted through a web browser   </p>
       <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive web pages and web applications.

        JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and has a vast community of developers who share resources, tutorials, and libraries to help beginners. It is dynamically typed, meaning that variables can change their data type at runtime, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code.
        
        In short words, JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.)</p>
        <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for web development. Learning the basics of JavaScript is fairly simple. However, this language is highly interactive and has many complex features and nuances when used at an advanced level. As projects become more reliant on JavaScript, employers increasingly seek out candidates with strong JavaScript skills. In this article, we explain what JavaScript is, its uses and advantages and how to begin developing JavaScript skills to advance in your career.)</p>
