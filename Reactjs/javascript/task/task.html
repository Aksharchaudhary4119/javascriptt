    <h2>what is function</h2>
        <p>Ans = A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable</p>
        <p>Ans = JavaScript variables are used to store data that can be changed later on. The ariables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container</p>
        <p>Ans = A JavaScript variable is just like a container to store value. The name of the JavaScript variable must be as per the identifier rules.

            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter(a-z), underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($), and further characters can be digits (0-9). Also, JavaScript is case-sensitive language and JavaScript keywords cannot be used as JavaScript identifier names</p>
        <p>Ans = Variables are used whenever there’s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places</p>
        
        <h2>what is variables</h2>
        <p>Ans = Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value)</p>

            Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. In JavaScript, you can declare the variables in 4 ways −
            
            Without using any keywords.
            
            Using the 'var' keyword.
            
            Using the 'let' keyword.
            
            Using the 'const' keyword.</p>
